                <p>Sherin Valestrand <br>
                    30 years old, from<br>
                    Sweden, Gothenburg.<br>
                    Current Location: Barcelona!<br><br>
                    Degree: Bachelor of Business <br> Marketing, Management, Innovation & Finance Management  <br> University of Technology, Sydney
                </p>

            <b>Why Me</b>

                <p>Currently doing a practical course in Web Development within E-commerce <br>
                    at Medieinstitutet, Gothenburg (distance learning). <br>
                    At the moment I have three digital lectures per week. <br>
                    However, if an opportunity would appear I will put my studies on hold! <br>
                </p>
                <br>
                I came back to Sweden from Australia in July 2020. I graduated in December 2019. <br> 
                    As it seemed as the corona virus was going to limit job opportunities, <br>
                    I took the time to start learning to code by starting my current course. <br>
                    (as I love to inspire, create and design things. That is how I was able to build by coding in HTML & CSS) <br><br>
                
            <br> <br>
                I am new to Barcelona, since the beginning of January. <br> I speak a very little spanish, but I am eager to learn!
                <br><br>
                My most current workplace was at Bondi Icebergs Club, where I was working while stutying, <br> and after graduating. 
                I was assistant event manager, bartender, and door host. <br> I took bookings and organised package deals, as well as uniqe enquiries. <br>
                
              <br>  Listed under EXPERIENCE, in the bar above, a few work places are mentioned. <br> I have more experiences, such as creating adverts for a newspaper in Gothenburg,<br> 
                called Göteborgs-Posten, one of the biggest daily newspaper in Sweden. <br>
               
                <br> 
                <p>Driven by a passion for marketing, technology and design,<br> combined with strengths, as 
                    patience, curiousity, efficiency and creativity, <br>
                    I see existing and upcoming obsecles, as an opportunity to learn, grow and evolve.  <br>
                    <br>
                    
            
                <br>
                I have spent the majority of the 7 years abroad, and speak and write fluent english. <br>
                I love a challange, and to be able to solve problems by being stragetic, creative and innovative!</p> 
                <h4>Thank you for taking your time!</h4>
