                <p>Sherin Valestrand <br>
                    30 years old, from<br>
                    Swedish, Gothenburg.<br>
                    Current Location: Barcelona!<br><br>
                    Degree: Bachelor of Business <br> Marketing, Management, Innovation & Finance <br> University of Technology, Sydney
                </p>

                <p>Currently doing a practical course in Web Development at Medieinstitutet, Gothenburg. <br>
                I am based in Barcelona, since the studies is on distance at the moment.</p> <br>

                
                
            <b>Why Me</b>
                <p>Driven by a passion for design combined with strengths as 
                    patience, curiousity, efficiency and creativity, <br>I see existing and upcoming obsecles, as an opportunity to learn, grow and evolve.  <br><br>
                I came back to Sweden from Australia in July 2020. I graduated in December 2019. <br> As it seemed as the corona virus was going to limit job opportunities, I took the time to start learning to code by starting my current course in web development within e-commerse.  <br>(as I love to inspire, create and design things. This CV was build in HTML and CSS by me) <br><br>

                At the moment I have 3 digital lectures per week. However, if an opportunity would appear I can put my studies on hold! <br>
                

                My most current workplace was bartender and assistant event manager at a venue called Icebergs, Sydney. I took bookings and organised package deals, as well as uniqe enquiries. <br>
                Listed under Experiance, in the bar above, a few work places are mantioned. I have more experiances, such as creating ads for a newpaper in Gothenburg,<br> called GÃ¶teborgs-Posten, one of Swedens biggest daily newspaper. <br>
               
            
            
                <br>
                I have spent the majority of the 7 years abroad, in Sydney Australia, and speak and write fluent english. <br>
                I love a challange, and to be able to solve problems by being creative and innovative!</p> 
                <h4>Thank you for taking your time!</h4>
